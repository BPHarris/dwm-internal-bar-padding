# dwm-internal-bar-padding


# Description

A [dwm patch](https://suckless.org/hacking/) to allow for the addition of internal padding to the elements in the bar provided by [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) (i.e. tags, window title, and status).

Padding is controled by the variables `barvpadpx` and `barhpadpx` in the user's config header. The former is applied as both the left *and* right padding of each element, and the latter as the top *and* bottom padding.

Similar patches:
* [statuspadding](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuspadding) -- though this did not behave as expected for me.
